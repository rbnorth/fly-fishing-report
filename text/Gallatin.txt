Fishing Coditions for the Gallatin.

The Gallatin is fishing great. We have all been running chubbies, caddis or sallies for our top bug. Behind that we have been fishing various perdigons, iron sally's, tungsten split case pmd's, hare's ears, prince nymphs and stoneflies. Salmon flies are now by the park, so fishing anywhere above the taylors fork would be a good option to fish for salmon flies. Goldenstones will continue to hatch throughout the canyon. If you want to go dry or die, fish a chubby as your top fly and an x-caddis or missing link caddis as your dropper.
