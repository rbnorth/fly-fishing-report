Fishing Coditions for the Boulder.

The Horn is fishing excellent right now. There are lots of Pmd's and caddis out so it's always a good idea to have a few in your box. For Pmd's we suggest using hackle stackers, sparkle stackers, last chance pmd, cripple pmd and parachute pink pmd's. For caddis, try a missing link caddis, x caddis, and delektable hair caddis. Nymphers are having good luck as well. All with classic tailwater flies such as sowbugs, Scuds, worms, midges, pmd nymphs, and various caddis pupa's. Streamer bite has been variable depending on the day, morning and evening are always the best time to target them with streamers. Try a sparkle minnow, wooly bugger, mccune's sculpin, mini dungeon, kreelex, rusty trombone, goldie, and sculpzilla.
