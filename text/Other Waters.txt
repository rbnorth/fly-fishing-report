Fishing Coditions for the Other Waters.

Beaverhead- Water is basically a trickle over here, there are better places to go. 
Canyon Ferry - 
Hauser/Holter -  Try stripping leeches, scuds, and chironomids.
Hyalite- The lake and the creek are both fishing very good. If you are headed to the lake, try a balanced leech under an indicator or a purple para wulff with a dropper underneath. If you are fishing the creek, a dry dropper has been the most productive. 
Cliff and Wade - The lakes have reopened from a fire closure.  Chironomids and Midge dries are your best bet out this way.  
Quake Lake - Quake lake has been fishing okay. Stripping leeches and small streamers has been productive, just be prepared to lose some flies as there is a ton of debris in the water. Dry fly fishing has picked up a little bit too.
Hebgen- 
Harrison Lake - Look for fish to be off the shallow points and near the weed beds.  Callibaetis are everywhere right now.  Watch for high winds!
Ennis Lake- Watch for wind out this way. Fishing has been tougher out this way as this is a shallow lake and the water is heating up considerably.
Ponds Around Town - A great place to take the kids to catch a few bluegill and maybe even a rainbow.
