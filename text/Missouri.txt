Fishing Coditions for the Missouri.

The water temperatures on the Mighty Mo have been in the 60's which has made for some great fishing. The BWO's have been seen sporadically,  the nymph bite has been good with caddis pupa and the usuals which are sow bugs, scuds, worms, midges and small flashy mayfly patterns like craven's two bit hooker. Streamers have also been a great go-to with all colors depending on the time of day.
