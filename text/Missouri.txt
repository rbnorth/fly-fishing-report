Fishing Coditions for the Missouri.

PMD's have been hatching all over the river with the warmth. If you see PMD's out, fish a pull over pmd in a sz 16, high viz pmd sz 16 or 18, last chance cripple pmd sz 16 and a rusty spinner in the evenings. Levels have been fluctuating the past few days so nymphing will be a a good choice. For pmd nymphs, use a split case pmd perdigon and a split case pmd in a sz 14-18 as a dropper. Classic MO nymphs like a ray charles, midges, sow bugs, and scuds, caddis pupa's and worms have all been productive of course.
