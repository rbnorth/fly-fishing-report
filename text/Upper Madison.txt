Fishing Coditions for the Upper Madison.

The Upper Madison has been fishing good. The streamer bite has been awesome in the mornings. After the morning streamer bite has subsided, BWO's are out and about but a full dropper rig has been the best bet. For droppers, anything small and flashy will get the job done: Green Machines, $3 dips, purple deaths, goblins, copper johns, prince nymphs, Perdigons, worms, shop vacs, black & brown rubber legs are all good bets.  There have been a lot of big brown trout caught very early in the morning on big streamers as of late. Streamer color has been variable lately, but typically black and olive are great colors on cloudier and rainy days and flashy, yellow, and white are our favorites for those sunny days.
