Fishing Coditions for the Upper Madison.

The upper madison has been fishing great. Salmonflies have made their way throughout the river, the best fishing for them will be up higher. Chubby droppers have been working well; try orange pink and copper chubby colors (size 8-16), wooly buggers and small attractor nymphs have been working great as a dropper.  Lots of caddis out as well, try missing link, x caddis or elk hair caddis size 14-16. Goldenstones, Yellow Sallies and PMD's will be your other options throughout the river.
