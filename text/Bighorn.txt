Fishing Coditions for the Bighorn.

The Bighorn is has been fishing well, however aquatic grass is coming into play.  We are seeing an abundance of PMD nymphs...hint hint.  There are a decent number of PMD adults, baetis and black caddis around also.  The nymphing is also a good way to get into fish these days.  Wade fishing has been pretty darn good throughout the entire river.  Carpet Bugs, Red Bead Rays, Split Case PMD’s, Poxyback PMD’s, Fold-over PMD's, Tungteasers, rainbow sowbugs, perdigons, and Black Quills are the only nymphs you need right now.
