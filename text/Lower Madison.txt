Fishing Coditions for the Lower Madison.

The lower is currently pretty hot so be on the watch for high water temps and stressed fish. If you really want to fish the lower, fish it in the morning when the water temps are at their lowest, pinch your barbs, keep the fight short and keep 'em wet. Fish a dry dropper with a chubby or a stubby chubby and behind that throw small flashy nymphs. I.E. Nymphicators, perdigons, caddis pupa and iron sally's.
