Fishing Coditions for the Lower Madison.

The Lower Madison is fishing well. Sub-surface will be your most productive option with a variety of things working such as a crayfish, BWO nymphs, Perdigons, Scuds and Soft Hackles. If you find yourself craving some dry fly action, starting mid morning BWO's and Midges will be a great option. There is a a great streamer bite if you can stay out of the weeds!  Also, play around with where you are putting your flies as we have seen them being caught in all types of waters; buckets, shelfs, and shallows depending on the time of day.
