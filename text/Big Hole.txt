Fishing Coditions for the Big Hole.

The Big Hole is fishing good. Golden stones will be around as well as yellow sallies, pmds and caddis. Streamer and nymph fishing has been productive as well. Yellow yummies, Yellow dungeons and anything yellow will work for browns and small and flashy will work for rainbows. For nymphing, use caddis pupas, sally nymphs, rubber legs, pmd nymphs and spankers. Watch for high water temps and stressed fish with the warmer weather.
